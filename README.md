Calculate TFIDF for language learning, following the approach outlined by the YouTube Channel [One Word At A Time](https://www.youtube.com/@OneWordataTime1) in their video, [What to do when language rushes by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJyJ7DLmSfQ).


# How to use

To be written

# Known issues

So far, this script has only been tested with Mandarin Chinese, using Simplified Characters. The script may fail entirely for other languages, especially those that have conjugations / cases. My hope is that by looking at the source code, you can modify for your given language.
